# Software Engineering Arena

</div>

[Software Engineering Arena](https://huggingface.co/SWE-Arena) is an open-source initiative to transparently evaluate and track AI assistants across real-world software engineering tasks. We provide interactive platforms, tracking systems, and novel metrics to advance the field of AI-assisted software development.

> **"The easier it is to verify a solution, the faster an AI system can learn to master the task."** — [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990116666194456651), [Jason Wei](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/asymmetry-of-verification-and-verifiers-law)

**Our mission:** We believe any evaluable task can eventually be automated with high-quality AI systems. We accelerate this transformation in software engineering by developing benchmarks and leaderboards that rigorously evaluate AI capabilities.

**Welcome collaboration from research labs, independent contributors, and the broader SE community!**
