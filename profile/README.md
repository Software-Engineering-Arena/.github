# Software Engineering Arena

</div>

[Software Engineering Arena](https://huggingface.co/SWE-Arena) is an open-source initiative to transparently evaluate and track AI coding agents across real-world software engineering tasks. We provide interactive platforms, tracking systems, and novel metrics to advance the field of AI-assisted software development. 

> **“The easier it is to verify a solution, the faster an AI system can learn to master the task.” — Jason Wei¹**

**Our mission:** We believe any evaluable task can eventually be automated with high-quality AI systems. We accelerate this transformation in software engineering by developing benchmarks and leaderboards that rigorously evaluate AI capabilities.

**Welcome collaboration from research labs, independent contributors, and the broader SE community!**

## 🏟️ [SWE-Model-Arena](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Model-Arena): Interactive Multi-Round Model Evaluation

[![SWE-Model-Arena](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Model--Arena-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena)

An interactive platform for evaluating foundation models through **pairwise comparisons** in multi-round conversational workflows. Unlike static benchmarks, SWE-Model-Arena enables:

- **Multi-round dialogues** reflecting real-world SE interactions
- **Repository-aware context** via RepoChat for authentic evaluations
- **Novel metrics** including model consistency score and conversation efficiency index
- **Transparent leaderboard** with open-sourced ranking algorithms

Perfect for researchers and engineers seeking nuanced, context-aware assessments of AI models on software engineering tasks.

## 📊 GitHub-Based Agent Tracking Suite

## 🎯 Our Mission

Software engineering extends far beyond code generation—it encompasses requirements engineering, collaborative design, code review, debugging, and project management. Current evaluation frameworks often focus narrowly on code completion or generation. 

**Software Engineering Arena** provides:

- ✅ **Holistic evaluation** across diverse SE activities
- ✅ **Multi-turn interactions** matching real-world workflows  
- ✅ **Transparent methodologies** for reproducible research
- ✅ **Open-source tools** for community-driven innovation
- ✅ **Rich datasets** to advance AI-assisted software development

## 🤝 Get Involved

We're actively seeking collaborators! Whether you're a:
- 🔬 **Researcher** developing new evaluation metrics
- 🛠️ **Engineer** building AI coding tools
- 📊 **Data scientist** analyzing model performance
- 🌐 **Open source contributor** improving our platforms

**Ways to contribute:**
- Submit PRs to enhance our evaluation platforms
- Propose new metrics or tracking methodologies  
- Share datasets or evaluation results
- Report issues and suggest improvements
- Join discussions in our repositories
