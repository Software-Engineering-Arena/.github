# Software Engineering Arena

</div>

[Software Engineering Arena](https://huggingface.co/SWE-Arena) is an open-source initiative to transparently evaluate and track AI assistants across real-world software engineering tasks. We provide interactive platforms, tracking systems, and novel metrics to advance the field of AI-assisted software development.

> **"The easier it is to verify a solution, the faster an AI system can learn to master the task."** — [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990116666194456651), [Jason Wei](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/asymmetry-of-verification-and-verifiers-law)

**Our mission:** We believe any evaluable task can eventually be automated with high-quality AI systems. We accelerate this transformation in software engineering by developing benchmarks and leaderboards that rigorously evaluate AI capabilities.

**Welcome collaboration from research labs, independent contributors, and the broader SE community!**

## ⚔️ Arena-Based Tracking Suite

Evaluate AI assistants through pairwise comparisons in user-oriented software engineering scenarios:

### [SWE-Model-Arena](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Model-Arena) [![SWE-Model-Arena](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Model--Arena-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena)

Evaluate **foundation models** through pairwise comparisons in multi-round conversational workflows with repository-aware context and transparent leaderboards.

## 📊 GitHub-Based Tracking Suite

Evaluate AI assistants through their actual GitHub activity:

### [SWE-Issue](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Issue) [![SWE-Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Issue-yellow?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/SWE-Issue)
Track assistants via issue tracking ecosystem—bug reports, feature requests, outstanding issue resolution, community discussions, question answering, and polls.

### [SWE-PR](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-PR) [![SWE-PR](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--PR-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/SWE-PR)
