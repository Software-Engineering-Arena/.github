# Software Engineering Arena

</div>

[Software Engineering Arena](https://huggingface.co/SWE-Arena) is an open-source initiative to transparently evaluate and track AI coding agents across real-world software engineering tasks. We provide interactive platforms, tracking systems, and novel metrics to advance the field of AI-assisted software development. 

> **“The easier it is to verify a solution, the faster an AI system can learn to master the task.” — Jason Wei¹**

**Our mission:** We believe any evaluable task can eventually be automated with high-quality AI systems. We accelerate this transformation in software engineering by developing benchmarks and leaderboards that rigorously evaluate AI capabilities.

**Welcome collaboration from research labs, independent contributors, and the broader SE community!**

## 🏟️ [SWE-Model-Arena](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Model-Arena): Interactive Multi-Round Model Evaluation

An interactive platform for evaluating foundation models through **pairwise comparisons** in multi-round conversational workflows. Unlike static benchmarks, SWE-Model-Arena enables:

- **Multi-round dialogues** reflecting real-world SE interactions
- **Repository-aware context** via RepoChat for authentic evaluations
- **Novel metrics** including model consistency score and conversation efficiency index
- **Transparent leaderboard** with open-sourced ranking algorithms

Perfect for researchers and engineers seeking nuanced, context-aware assessments of AI models on software engineering tasks.
