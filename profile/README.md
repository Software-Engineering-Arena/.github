# Software Engineering Arena

</div>

[Software Engineering Arena](https://huggingface.co/SWE-Arena) is an open-source initiative to transparently evaluate and track AI coding agents across real-world software engineering tasks. We provide interactive platforms, tracking systems, and novel metrics to advance the field of AI-assisted software development. 

**Welcome collaboration from research labs, independent contributors, and the broader SE community!**



## 🏟️ [SWE-Model-Arena](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Model-Arena): Interactive Multi-Round Model Evaluation

[![SWE-Model-Arena](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Model--Arena-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena)

An interactive platform for evaluating foundation models through **pairwise comparisons** in multi-round conversational workflows. Unlike static benchmarks, SWE-Model-Arena enables:

- **Multi-round dialogues** reflecting real-world SE interactions
- **Repository-aware context** via RepoChat for authentic evaluations
- **Novel metrics** including model consistency score and conversation efficiency index
- **Transparent, open-source leaderboard** with advanced ranking algorithms
- **Code execution** across multiple languages in sandboxed environments

Perfect for researchers and engineers seeking nuanced, context-aware assessments of AI models on software engineering tasks.

## 📊 GitHub-Based Agent Tracking Suite

Evaluate AI coding agents through their actual GitHub activity with our comprehensive tracking systems:

### [SWE-Commit](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Commit)

Track and analyze AI coding agents via their **commits**—measuring code quality, consistency, and contribution patterns.

### [SWE-PR](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-PR) 
[![SWE-PR](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--PR-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/SWE-PR)

Track and analyze AI coding agents via their **pull requests**—examining merge success rates, discussion quality, and iterative improvements.

### [SWE-Review](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Review) 
[![SWE-Review](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Review-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/SWE-Review)

Track and analyze AI coding agents via their **code reviews**—assessing feedback quality, issue identification, and collaborative capabilities.

### [SWE-Issue](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-Arena/SWE-Issue) 
[![SWE-Issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/🏟️-Try%20SWE--Issue-yellow?style=for-the-badge)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/SWE-Issue)

Track and analyze AI coding agents via their **issue trackers**—from bug reports to feature requests and documentation.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Software engineering extends far beyond code generation—it encompasses requirements engineering, collaborative design, code review, debugging, and project management. Current evaluation frameworks often focus narrowly on code completion or generation. 

**Software Engineering Arena** provides:

- ✅ **Holistic evaluation** across diverse SE activities
- ✅ **Multi-turn interactions** matching real-world workflows  
- ✅ **Transparent methodologies** for reproducible research
- ✅ **Open-source tools** for community-driven innovation
- ✅ **Rich datasets** to advance AI-assisted software development
